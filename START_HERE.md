# 🚀 START HERE - Medical Self-Play Training

## Quick Start (2 Commands)

On your SSH server:

```bash
# 1. First time setup (20-30 min)
./quick_start.sh

# 2. Launch training (2-4 hours)
./launch_training.sh
```

That's it! ✅

---

## What These Scripts Do

### `quick_start.sh`
- Downloads your fine-tuned model (Abdine/qwen3-4b-medical-selfplay-sft)
- Installs OpenRLHF (from PyPI)
- Generates 638 training samples
- Verifies local reward function

### `launch_training.sh`
- Checks everything is ready
- Starts training with REINFORCE++
- Uses local judge (all on same GPU)
- Saves checkpoints every 50 steps

---

## What You'll Get

After training completes:

- **Trained models** in `checkpoints/medical_selfplay_RL_<timestamp>/`
- **Attacker model** that introduces realistic medical errors
- **Assessor model** that detects medical errors
- **Both models** improved through self-play

---

## Training Configuration

- **Starting model**: Your fine-tuned Qwen3-4B
- **Training data**: 638 samples (4-way balanced)
- **Algorithm**: REINFORCE++ (from Self-RedTeam paper)
- **Reward**: Zero-sum medical error detection
- **Time**: ~2-4 hours on GPU

---

## Monitoring

```bash
# Watch training progress
tail -f checkpoints/medical_selfplay_RL_*/logs/training.log

# Check GPU usage (all models on same GPU)
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```
